Mondo License Grinder MMX v.0.1

Notes
-----
The author makes no claim that this is an innovative or complex solution; 
rather this is a pure CRUD (Create/Report/Update/Delete) application. All it
does is provide an interface to a simple database. It doesn't connect to an 
ERM, or pull in license data from a publisher, or anything cool like that.

Requirements
------------
MySQL 5+
PHP 5.1+

Installation notes
------------------

There isn't any interactive installation script. So:

1) Create a database (only MySQL has been tested). Note the database name, 
   user, and password. Import the file "licenses.sql" to get a blank schema.
   
2) Copy config.php-dist to config.php. Modify the DB* constants to reflect
   the values you recored in 1). If you want to host your own jQuery scripts, 
   go ahead and change the JQUERY and JQUERYUI constants to point at yours
   instead.
   Change the BASE_URL define to the Web location of your installation. It 
   doesn't need to have its own domain, but the trailing slash (/) is required.
   
3) Copy header.inc.php-dist to header.inc.php and footer.inc.php-dist to 
   footer.inc.php. Make any modifications you like.

4) Enable HTTP Basic authentication on the staff/ and admin/ directories. There 
   is a sample "htaccess-dist" supplied in each directory. Copy these to 
   ".htaccess" in their respective directories
   
4a) A htaccess-dist has been added to the site root as well since Google Code
    doesn't seem to want to show it. Copy this to .htaccess in the same directory as well.
    
5) You may need to edit the .htaccess file in the site root and/or enable 
   mod_rewrite. Currently the site probably won't work without mod_rewrite.

6) If all has gone well, visiting {BASE_URL} (configured in config.php) will 
   show the public-facing app.

7) Go to {BASE_URL}/admin to begin entering your license data. Or optionally
   you can download our starter database from:
